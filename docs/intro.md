# My WriteTech Accelerator Portfolio

This repository contains all my project work and deliverables from the **[WriteTech Accelerator Programme 2025](https://writetechhub.org/accelerator-program/)**.

Over the course of the bootcamp, I completed technical writing projects across various domains including API documentation, AI, DevOps, automation, and Web3, using modern documentation workflows, tools, and Docs-as-Code practices.

## About Me

I'm AbdulRaheem Olurode, a Technical Writer and Documentation Engineer. I specialize in creating clear, user-focused technical content, and I’m passionate about improving software and API documentation for better usability. This portfolio showcases the practical skills I’ve built during the WriteTech Accelerator Programme, as well as my journey exploring Docs-as-Code workflows.
